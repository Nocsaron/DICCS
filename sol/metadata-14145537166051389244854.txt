And the funding sources: National Science Funding: EAR-0922307.  Please use either snow on/off or leaf on/off for all sites. For the credit, use my name, and PIs of the site (e.g. Qinghua, Roger Bales), check the CZO website for the name of PIs (there are one site which has two PIs). For leave on/off site, please use this title: Leaf-on and leaf-off LiDAR point cloud data and digital elevation models for study of hydrologic, geomorphologic, and geochemical processes at XXXX (need to fill in the specific site name) Critical Zone Observatory.  LiDAR data are collected by the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM - http://www.ncalm.org), with project director Qinghua Guo, funded by National Science Foundation (EAR-0922307). .
